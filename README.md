# One-Week-Couple

The project was developed through SVN. Github is only used for sharing the final results.

The project requires users to input information such as names, ages, hobbies... to store at the web server.

One the acquicition is complete, a pairing software is used to find the best match(the ideal person to try dating with) among the database for each person. Pairing results will be displayed on the software and stored as a local .xls file.

Due to the limitation of file size on Github, the software cannot be seen on this website.
